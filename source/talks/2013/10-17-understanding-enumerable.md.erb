*This article is a work-in-progress. The first section is aimed at newcomers to Ruby, so feel free to skip it if you already know it.*

[Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Enumerable.html) is a fascinating mixin. Its use makes for unusual, characteristic, and expressive Ruby code. In this talk, we'll take a look at Ruby's `Array` class, discuss why Rubyists don't use `for`, and learn how to count the uncountable.

## Forming arrays

When I first starting writing Ruby, I remember being impressed with the breadth and expressiveness of the standard library. Perhaps none stood out to me more than the `Array` class. 

Let's look at a few examples. You can try any of these examples using the interactive console that ships with Ruby, `irb`. Just type `irb` in a terminal and hit return to start an interactive Ruby session.

Let's start by creating an array:

```ruby
parents = ["Ned", "Catelyn"]
# => ["Ned", "Catelyn"]
```

Nothing out of the ordinary here, but there's a simpler way to write arrays of whitespace-separated values:

```ruby
children = %w( Robb Sansa Arya Bran Rickon )
# => ["Robb", "Sansa", "Arya", "Bran", "Rickon"]
```

Now, let's combine the two arrays together:

```ruby
starks = parents + children
# => ["Ned", "Catelyn", "Robb", "Sansa", "Arya", "Bran", "Rickon"]
```

Seems natural, right? Subtraction works too:

```ruby
starks - children
# => ["Ned", "Catelyn"]
```

Accessing items:

```ruby
starks.first # => "Ned"
starks.at(3) # => "Sansa"
starks[-1] # => "Rickon"
starks[3..5] # => ["Sansa", "Arya", "Bran"]
```

In the last example, `3..5` is a `Range`. We'll come back to those later.

## Array iteration

Ruby has a `for` loop:

```ruby
for name in starks
  puts name
end
```

You won't often see it used, though. Instead, most Rubyists will use `each`:

```ruby
starks.each do |name|
  puts name
end
```

There's an important distinction, and we'll come back to it later. For the moment, just take a look at this example.

Between the `do` and `end` we have a block. You can think of a block as an anonymous function or a closure, if you're familiar with those concepts. Otherwise, just think of it as a “block” of code.

The block gets executed once per item in the array.

Another way to write a block is with curly braces. The following is identical to the last example:

```ruby
starks.each { |name| puts name }
```

What if we wanted the index, too?

```ruby
starks.each_with_index { |name, i| puts "#{i}. #{name}" }
```

Which would print:

```
1. Ned
2. Catelyn
3. Robb
...
```

## Filtering and sorting arrays

Many of the methods on arrays use blocks.

Let's try filtering an array:

```ruby
starks.select { |name| name.end_with?('a') }
# => ["Sansa", "Arya"]
```

When using `select`, the *return value* of the block will be evaluated to determine which elements are returned in the new array. In Ruby, all methods and blocks have a return value, in this case the last line of the block.

Similar to `select`, we have `reject`:

```ruby
starks.reject { |name| name.include?('a') }
# => ["Ned", "Robb", "Rickon"]
```

`sort` is available:

```ruby
starks.sort
# => ["Arya", "Bran", "Catelyn", "Ned", "Rickon", "Robb", "Sansa"]
```

Because most methods on array return another array, you can chain methods together:

```ruby
starks.sort.reverse
=> ["Sansa", "Robb", "Rickon", "Ned", "Catelyn", "Bran", "Arya"]
```

Here, we're using a block sorting by the length of their name:

```ruby
starks.sort_by { |name| name.length }
# => => ["Sansa", "Arya", "Robb", "Ned", "Catelyn", "Bran", "Rickon"]
```

If you want to call a single method on each item, there's a shorthand syntax for that:

```ruby
starks.sort_by(&:length)
```

I won't discuss how this works, but it's pretty neat if you want to [find out for yourself](http://phrogz.net/symbol-to-proc-with-multiple-arguments).

## Transforming arrays

What if we wanted to transform all the names?

```ruby
starks.map { |stark| stark.upcase }
# => ["NED", "CATELYN", "ROBB", "SANSA", "ARYA", "BRAN", "RICKON"]
```

Let's add the last name to each member of the Stark house. This time, we're going to use `map`'s brother, `map!`:

```ruby
starks.map! { |first_name| "#{first_name} Stark" }
# => => ["Ned Stark", "Catelyn Stark", "Robb Stark", "Sansa Stark", "Arya Stark", "Bran Stark", "Rickon Stark"]
```

The difference between `map` and `map!` is that `map` will return a *new* array, while `map!` will modify the existing array.

In the same way, `select` and `reject` have `select!` and `reject!` counterparts that modify the original array rather than retuen a new one.

**Ruby Tip:** The exclamation mark (also known as the *bang*), is a perfectly valid character to use as part of a method name. Rubyists tend to use exclamation marks at the end of their methods to let other developers know that the method is dangerous. It might be making permanent changes to your object, database, or doing something unexpected.

## Searching for answers

Now that we have all our Starks properly named, let's add one more:

```ruby
starks << "Jon Snow"
=> ["Ned Stark", "Catelyn Stark", "Robb Stark", "Sansa Stark", "Arya Stark", "Bran Stark", "Rickon Stark", "Jon Snow"]
```

How would we know if this array contained someone whose last name was Snow? We could use `select`, but it would have to iterate through every item in the array, even if it had already found a Snow. Wouldn't it be better if we had a method that returned `true` the moment it found one?

```ruby
starks.any? { |name| name.ends_with?('Snow') }
# => true
```

The question mark in the `any?` method is similar to the exclamation mark before – it's simply a Ruby convention, this time to indicate a method that returns a true (or [truthy](https://gist.github.com/jfarmer/2647362)) value.

```ruby
starks.all? { |name| name.ends_with?('Stark') }
# => false

starks.delete('John Snow')
starks.all? { |name| name.ends_with?('Stark') }
# => true
```

## Range iteration

Now you've seen a few tricks from the `Array` class, let's take a look at another common class, `Range`:

```ruby
(0..5).each { |n| puts n }
```

Notice how we're using `each` again. Here's a method that allows us to iterate over the range in slices:

```ruby
(1..100).each_slice(5) { |set| puts set.inspect }
```

Which would produce:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
...snip...
[96, 97, 98, 99, 100]
```

## Counting to Infinity

In most languages, dividing by zero raises an error:

```
>>> 1.0/0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero
```

Not so in Ruby:

```ruby
Infinity = 1.0/0
# => Infinity
```

Interestingly, you can create a range that uses Infinity:

```ruby
all_positive_numbers = 0..Infinity
all_positive_numbers.include?(3) # => true
all_positive_numbers.include?(41343124) # => true
us_debt = 17_000_000_000_000
all_positive_numbers.include?(us_debt) # => true
```

You can even create a range between negative and positive Infinity:

```ruby
all_numbers = -Infinity..Infinity
all_numbers.include?(-35623) # => true
```

You could, if you wanted to, use `each` to iterate over every postive number. It may take some time:

```ruby
all_positive_numbers.each { |n| puts n }
```

Better, though to perhaps take a few:

```ruby
all_positive_numbers.take(5)
# => => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Or perhaps in slices:

```ruby
 all_positive_numbers.each_slice(5).take(2)
=> [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]
```

Notice how we didn't pass a block to `each_slice` this time? I wonder what happens if we just call `each` by itself?

```ruby
enumerator = all_positive_numbers.each
# => #<Enumerator: 0..Infinity:each>

enumerator.next # => 0
enumerator.next # => 1
enumerator.next # => 2
```

Interesting.

## Hashes

Hashes allow table-like mappings between names and values:

```ruby
sigils = {
  'Stark'     => 'Direwolf',
  'Lannister' => 'Lion',
  'Greyjoy'   => 'Kraken'
}
```

Hashes, too, have an `each` method:

```ruby
sigils.each do |house, animal|
  puts "The sigil of House #{house} is a #{animal}."
end
```

Let's have a look at the methods on a Hash:

```ruby
Hash.instance_methods
# => [..., :each, :map, :select, :reject, :all?, :any?, ...]
```

Hmm, these are the same methods that appear on the `Array` and `Range` classes.

## Introducing Enumerable

`Array`, `Range`, and `Hash` share a number of identical (and useful) methods. How is this happening?

The answer that each of these classes include the Enumerable module. With a module, you can define a number of methods. Other classes can include that module to borrow its methods.

You can mix in Enumerable to any class which implements the `each` method. In other words, all the methods you've seen so far (`select`, `each_with_index`, `all?`, `map`, etc.) have been written purely in terms of `each`.

*This article is a work in progress. Still to come: writing your own class that implements `each`.*
