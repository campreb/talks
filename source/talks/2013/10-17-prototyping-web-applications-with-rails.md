venue: Christchurch Ruby
intro: Tonight I want to go back to the good old days of not knowing any better, and show you how little effort it takes to throw together a prototype web application using generators and scaffolds and lots of bad hacks.

Tonight I want share a development style that Rails is very good at,
but one that doesn't get a lot of love in the community.

When I first discovered Ruby on Rails in my days of writing spaghetti PHP,
I was amazed with how fast you could write basic web applications.
However, as we become better developers and learn how to do things *properly*,
we spend more and more time thinking about testing and decoupling and encapsulation and what to name our variables.
In other words: no matter how good your tools are, doing things *well* is hard and takes time.

So tonight I want to go back to the good old days of not knowing any better,
and show you how little effort it takes to throw together a prototype web application using generators and scaffolds and lots of bad hacks.
